It has a highly reactive thioester bond which allows it to bind covalently to the surface on which it is generated.

The classical pathway C3 convertase is formed from membrane-bound C4b complexed with the protease C2b. The alternative pathway of complement activation uses a different but homologous C3 convertase, formed from membrane-bound C3b complexed with the protease Bb.

Cf. delayed-type hypersensitivity.",
    "immune clearance":"When large amounts of antigen are injected into the blood, they are initially removed slowly by normal catabolic processes that also degrade plasma proteins. However, if the antigen elicits an antibody response, then antigen is removed at an accelerated rate as antigen:antibody complexes, a process known as immune clearance.",
    "immune complex":"The binding of antibody to a soluble antigen forms an immune complex. Large immune complexes form when sufficient antibody is available to cross-link the antigen; these are readily cleared by the reticuloendothelial system of cells bearing Fc and complement receptors.

Immunoglobulin domains are characteristic of proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which includes antibodies, T-cell receptors, MHC molecules, and many other proteins described in this book.

Many different forms of inflammation are  The cells that invade tissues undergoing inflammatory responses are often called inflammatory cells or an inflammatory infiltrate.",
    "innate immunity":"The early phases of the host response to infection depend on innate immunity in which a variety of innate resistance mechanisms recognize and respond to the presence of a pathogen.

Uncharged proteins no longer migrate; thus each protein is focused at its isoelectric point.",
    "isotype switching":"The first antibodies produced in a humoral immune response are IgM, but activated B cells subsequently undergo isotype switching or class switching to secrete antibodies of different isotypes: IgG, IgA, and IgE. Isotype switching does not affect antibody specificity significantly, but alters the effector functions that an antibody can engage. Isotype switching occurs by recombination involving the deletion of DNA between the rearranged V region and the selected C-region exon at so-called S regions.",
    "isotypes":"Immunoglobulins are made in several distinct isotypes or classes—IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA, and IgE—each of which has a distinct heavy-chain C region encoded by a distinct C-region gene. The isotype of an antibody determines the effector mechanisms that it can engage on binding antigen. The different heavy-chain C regions are encoded in exons 3′ to the V(D)J rearrangement site. This allows the same antibody heavy-chain V region to link up with different heavy-chain C-region isotypes as a result of somatic recombination.",
